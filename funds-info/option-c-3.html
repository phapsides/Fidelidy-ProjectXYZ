							</p>
							<p class="p rhythm-m-0-half">Since 9 February 2014, these charges are split into two - this is called 'clean' pricing. The fund management costs will still be taken from a fund by its fund manager, and the investment platform you bought the fund through (in this case, Fidelity Personal Investing) will charge you a separate service fee for everything it offers you.
							</p>
							<p class="p rhythm-m-0-half">Our service fee is typically 0.35% for all the funds you hold under our pricing structure. From December 2015, we are going to charge the service fee at a flat rate of £45 a year (£25 for Junior ISAs and Junior SIPPs) if the total value of investments with Fidelity Personal investing is less than £7,500. For full details please refer to our <a href="https://www.fidelity.co.uk/static/pdf/Direct_Key_features_document.pdf" target="_blank">Doing business with Fidelity</a> document.
							</p>
							<p class="p rhythm-m-0-half">If you have more than £250,000 invested with Fidelity Personal Investing - across all your accounts and including all funds held under our old pricing structure - the service fee drops to 0.20%. This doesn't just apply to funds over the £250,000 level, it is applied to everything under the clean pricing structure, so the savings could be significant.
							</p>
							<p class="p rhythm-m-0-half">In addition, the service fee will only be charged on investments held up to £1,000,000. After this level no service fee will be charged on any additional investments.
							</p>
							<p class="p rhythm-m-0-half">Please note that for joint accounts, the applicable service fee will be assessed and payable on each account, regardless of the number accounts the named account holders hold together.
							</p>
							<p class="p rhythm-m-0-half">You do not need to do anything to pay the service fees. We will calculate them for you on the first of every month and automatically deduct them around the 15th of the following month. The fees will normally be taken from your largest holding by value within each account and will appear as 'Service Fee' on your statement.

                                You will either get the Ongoing Charge Figure (OCF) or the Total Expense Ratio (TER), depending on which is provided by the fund manager. In either case the figure is a recurring annual charge that the fund manager deducts directly from your holdings, and is equal to the total of the annual management charge plus the other expenses and our service fee.

                                The OCF is the expected cost of managing and operating all aspects of a fund for a year, including custodian/depositary transaction charges and excluding any performance fee which will be shown separately in the fund's Key Investor Information Document (KIID). The OCF is normally based on the fund's actual costs for the previous accounting period, and can vary from year to year.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p text-grey-85 rhythm-m-1">
                                The TER is based on the actual cost of managing and operating all aspects of a fund for a year, and may differ from the OCF if the fund has a performance fee which is included in the TER or if it is domiciled in Europe (in which case the TER will not include custodian/depositary transaction charges). Again, the TER can vary from year to year.
