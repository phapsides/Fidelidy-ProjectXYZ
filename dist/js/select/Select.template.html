Fidelity's Portfolio Managers use their experience and expertise and aim to get the best returns for your investments based on how much risk you're willing to take.</p><p class="p text-grey-85 rhythm-m-1">If you go for a high-risk attitude to your investments this will carry a higher chance of losing some, or all, of your money. Avoiding loss may not get you the return of investment as quickly - but it will be put into more secure assets, such as cash and bonds.</p><p class="p text-grey-85 rhythm-m-1">We urge our investors to make sure that their investments meet, and continue to meet, their own personal circumstances now and in the future. If you are unsure of your the investments you should choose, you should consult an independent financial adviser.</p><p class="p text-grey-85"><strong>1.
